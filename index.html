		<a href="https://www.wethinkcode.co.za/">WeThinkCode_</a> ,I embark on Thrilling adventures around the World Wide Web into the belly of Code so that one day i too shall become a Software engineering Master,I enjoy coding and building all kinds of Weapons from the Ground up, yes i am not just a Crusader and Sorcerer i am also a Black Smith of sorts.
		<br/><br/>
		Here is where my Journey Started....
		<br/><br/>
		Long long ago as a 16 year old lad, alongside my peers I had to choose specialties to study;however I only chose Visual Arts and Physical Sciences, not knowing what 3rd skill to add into my arsenal.
		<br/><br/>
		an Older Boy who seemed 10 fold stronger than me spoke a Tale about The Uphill battle of studying I.T(Information Technology) preaching to the masses he cried “do not embark on this Journey for many have failed” He turned his head my direction as if he could sense my attendance amidst the crowd, the fellow stared into my soul and further urged me to deviate from this treacherous path(How could this 12th Grader Discourage 9th Graders like that!!!), I smirked and turned my back towards him, “Challenge Accepted” I murmured under my breath as I faded into the faceless crowd.
		<br/><br/>
		I started learning “Scratch”(a visual programming language) the following year, then Delphi7 and Delphi 2010 the last two years of <a href="https://grenvillehigh.co.za/new-page/school-fees/" target="_blank">High school</a> and have been on the journey ever since.
		<br/><br/>
		On my quest into the C Jungle Filled with twists and turns, I met plenty of warriors and wizards such as Old Man Wolf, Number4 and Slimy who inspired me to stay strong. Finally The Binary Massiah spoke the word into my being, now there is no turning back,I must hone my skills and reach my full potential.
